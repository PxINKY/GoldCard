a. Gold Card is a public, privately owned discord bot using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) cloud hosting and python language to create a league of legends random champion + build generator.

b. Gold Card was created by me (PxINKY) with the help of a couple of close friends, started out as a passion project and evolved into a public bot that can be used in public / private Discord servers.
