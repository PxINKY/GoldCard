Gold Card is a public, privately owned discord bot using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) cloud hosting and [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/) + [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to create a league of legends random champion + build generator.

Gold Card was created by me (PxINKY) with the help of a couple of close friends, started out as a passion project and evolved into a public bot that can be used in public / private Discord servers.


### 1. Using Gold Card
a. Gold Card has permission to collect the following information:

* Guild name and ID

* Guild owners name and ID

* Guild user count

* User commands / messages containing the set Gold Card prefix (Default prefix: '>')

### 2. Why this information?
a. Guild name / ID
* The use of collecting Guild names and IDs allow me to log the total number of servers that Gold Card is in.
* This will also be used in the future for patreon / supporter exclusive commands / abilitys such as changing the prefix.
* Also if the TOS of Gold Card are broken this allows me to blacklist servers

b. Guild owners name and ID
* Relating to premium fetures, tracking the owners ID allows for efficient sorting of supporters and easy access.
* Tracking the ID (Non-changing identity) allows for the user to change there discord name without losing premium fetures / access.
