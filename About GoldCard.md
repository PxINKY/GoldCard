# Gold Card


### What is Gold Card?<br />
Im glad you asked!
Gold Card is a mock of the classic website "[ultimate bravery](https://www.ultimate-bravery.net/)"

### What is Ultimate Bravery? <br />
#### Quoted from Animesiac on Reddit
"TIL not everyone knows what Ultimate Bravery is.
There once was a website called ultimate-bravery.com which would assign you a random champ, 
random runes, and random items to build, and give you a random skill to max first. 
It eventually fell into disrepair and someone revived it over at http://www.ultimate-bravery.net. 
It appears to still be updated since Vex is in the champ pool.
The game mode was intended to be just for fun among friends, but I've often seen builds in real games that made me wonder."

### What is the difference? <br />
Gold Card is a discord bot programmed in python that can be added to any server.
Its convenient when you and your friends want to lay back and have some fun games without any meta builds
Grab a drink or two and roll the night away!

### How is this done? <br />
This is done by random number generators that select a random
-Champion
-Build
-Primary Runes
-Secondary Runes
-Summoner spells / Ability max order
And returns this information in 5 embeds which is then sent to the respective channel

### Sounds like fun! Where can i find this bot? <br />
